Hertz is commonly used to express the frequency of computer processors, electronic devices, and communication systems, as well as the frequency of sound waves and radio waves. For example, a computer processor with a clock speed of 2.5 GHz (gigahertz) can perform 2.5 billion cycles per second. The hertz is part of a series of units for measuring frequency that includes kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), and gigahertz (GHz)."
